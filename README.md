# Design-of-Low-Power-Compressor-using-CNTFET-Devices-for-Modern-Processors
# Abstract
The multi-operand addition and multiplication operations both frequently employ the compressor. Enhancing the compressor's performance has an impact on the multiplier's
capacity, which has an impact on the DSP's effectiveness. Therefore, increasing the compressor's performance has caught the attention of researchers. The Carbon Nanotube
Field-Effect Transistor (CNTFET)has supplanted the in Fin Field-Effect transistor (FinFET) because of the superior channel control, simplicity in pro/duction, high scaling, and capacity to address the short channel effects (SCEs). This study proposes and analyses a novel structural 4:2 compressor. Using Cadence's Virtuoso tool and 32 nm CNTFET technology, the proposed 4:2 compressor is simulated and contrasted with the existing 4:2 compressors. In comparison to the current compressors, the proposed compressor has lower power dissipation, power delay product (PDP), and energy delay product (EDP) values. In comparison to the best documented existing design, simulation results demonstrate that the suggested compressor reduces power dissipation by 17.94%, PDP by 25.09%, delay by 10.31% and EDP by 30.82%.
